# ensamblador

All the exercises and practices that I worked on while studying the "Computer System and Operating Systems" subject during my degree.

The exercises are in assembly code and/or C, they consist mainly of translations from C to assembly and vice versa, and different tests on a processor, such as obtaining the word sizes, understanding the different sections of the .elf file header...

All the assembler instructions studied are ARMv8-A, since a Raspberry Pi 3 with a Cortex-A53 processor was used.
